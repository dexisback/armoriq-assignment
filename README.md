## Overview

ArmorIQ is a secure AI agent platform built around one central idea:

> AI models should decide *what* they want to do, but independent infrastructure should decide *whether they are allowed to do it.*

Instead of allowing an LLM to directly invoke external tools, ArmorIQ inserts a dedicated Policy Engine between the model and every MCP tool execution.

Every tool request is evaluated against administrator-defined runtime policies before execution.

This architecture enables:

- Dynamic tool authorization
- Human approval workflows
- Runtime policy updates
- Prompt injection monitoring
- Centralized audit logging
- Live MCP tool discovery

The platform follows the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing tools to be discovered dynamically from both local and remote MCP servers without requiring application changes.

## Design Principles

The architecture is built around several core principles.

- Authorization is centralized.
- Tool discovery is dynamic.
- Runtime behavior is configuration-driven.
- Security decisions are deterministic.
- AI reasoning is separated from infrastructure authorization.
- Components communicate through well-defined boundaries.
- The platform remains extensible as additional MCP servers and policy types are introduced.

The repository follows a monorepo architecture where reusable runtime components are extracted into independent workspace packages. This keeps the Policy Engine, MCP Registry and shared contracts framework-agnostic and reusable across applications.

---

## Core Components

The platform is composed of three primary applications.

### AI Agent

The backend runtime responsible for orchestrating the complete tool-use lifecycle.

Responsibilities include:

- Running the LLM tool loop
- Discovering MCP tools
- Evaluating policies
- Executing authorized tools
- Recording audit events
- Managing approval workflows

---

### Administrative Dashboard

A web interface used to configure and observe the running agent.

Capabilities include:

- Policy management
- Tool catalog
- Approval queue
- Conversation logs
- Prompt injection events
- Runtime health monitoring
- Interactive chat playground

All dashboard changes are reflected by the running agent without requiring a restart.

---

### Custom MCP Server

A standards-compliant MCP server implementing infrastructure management tools.

Example tools include:

- Restart Server
- Deploy Release
- Rollback Release
- Get Server Status
- View Infrastructure Logs

The server is discovered dynamically by the MCP Registry without requiring any hardcoded tool definitions.

---

## Runtime Overview

Every user request follows the same execution pipeline.

    participant Agent as AI Agent
    participant LLM as LLM Provider

    Agent->>PE: Evaluate tool request
    alt POLICY ALLOWED
        PE-->>Agent: ALLOW

        Agent-->>User: Tool blocked by policy
    else APPROVAL REQUIRED
        PE-->>Agent: REQUIRE_APPROVAL
        Agent->>Audit: Log pending approval
        Agent-->>User: Awaiting human approval
        Note over Agent: Admin approves / denies
        Agent->>Registry: Execute tool (if approved)
        Registry->>MCP: Call tool
        MCP-->>Registry: Tool result
        Registry-->>Agent: Tool result
    end
    Agent->>LLM: Tool result + conversation
    LLM-->>Agent: Final response
    Agent-->>User: Response
    Agent->>Audit: Log execution event
```

The Policy Engine serves as the sole authorization boundary between AI reasoning and external tool execution, ensuring that every tool invocation is evaluated consistently before reaching an MCP server.


## Getting Started

> **Want to skip local setup?** This project is fully containerized. Clone, add a `.env`, and run one command:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/dexisback/armoriq-assignment.git
> cd armoriq-assignment
> cp .env.example .env
> # fill in your API keys
> docker compose up --build
> ```
>
> Dashboard: **http://localhost:3000** — Agent: **http://localhost:4000**
>
> See the [Docker](#docker) section below for details.

- pnpm 10+
- PostgreSQL (or a Neon database)
- Redis (or Upstash Redis)
- Google Gemini API Key
- Context7 API Key

---

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dexisback/armoriq-assignment.git

cd armoriq-assignment
```

---

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

### Environment Variables

pnpm dev
```

This starts:

| Service | Port |
|----------|------|
| Dashboard | `3000` |
| Agent API | `4000` |

---

## Docker

The project ships with a production-quality Docker setup. A new contributor needs only Docker and a single `.env` file — no Node.js, pnpm, or database installation required.

### What gets containerized

| Service    | Image               | Port  | Description                          |
|------------|---------------------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| `agent`    | `Dockerfile.agent`    | 4000  | Express API + MCP registry + policy engine |
| `dashboard`| `Dockerfile.dashboard`| 3000  | Next.js admin console                 |

The **custom MCP server** is *not* a separate container — the agent launches it internally via stdio, exactly as in local development. Redis (Upstash) and PostgreSQL (Neon) remain external hosted services.

### Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dexisback/armoriq-assignment.git
cd armoriq-assignment
cp .env.example .env
# fill in DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, GEMINI_API_KEY, GROK_API_KEY, CONTEXT7_API_KEY
docker compose up --build
```

Once both containers are healthy:

- **Dashboard:** http://localhost:3000
- **Agent API:** http://localhost:4000

### Architecture inside Docker

```mermaid
graph LR
    Browser([Browser]) -->|localhost:3000| Dash[dashboard<br/>Next.js]
    Dash -->|http://agent:4000| Agent[agent<br/>Express + tsx]

    Agent -->|stdio spawn| CustomMCP[custom-mcp<br/>Infrastructure Tools]
    Agent -->|stdio spawn| Ctx7[context7<br/>Library Docs]
    Agent -->|SQL| Neon[(Neon Postgres)]
    Agent -->|Pub/Sub| Upstash[(Upstash Redis)]
```

### How the pieces fit together

1. **Single `docker compose up --build`** builds both images and starts both services on a shared Docker network.
2. The **agent container** installs workspace dependencies, generates the Prisma client, builds `custom-mcp`, and runs the agent via `tsx`. It keeps `custom-mcp` as an internal stdio child process — no extra container.
3. The **dashboard container** builds Next.js with `AGENT_URL=http://agent:4000` baked into the rewrite config, so all `/api/*` requests are proxied to the agent over Docker networking.
4. Both containers read secrets from a single `.env` file via `env_file:`.

### Useful commands

```bash
# start in background
docker compose up -d

# view logs
docker compose logs -f

# view only the agent logs
docker compose logs -f agent

# stop
docker compose down

# rebuild from scratch (clears images + cache)
docker compose down --rmi all && docker compose up --build
```

### Notes

- The Docker setup does **not** change application architecture. `pnpm dev` continues to work locally exactly as before.
- The Prisma client is generated at build time inside the agent image (output: `/app/generated/prisma`).
- The custom MCP server is compiled at build time and launched by the agent via `node apps/custom-mcp/dist/index.js` (relative to `/app/apps/agent`).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://agent:4000` is set in `docker-compose.yml` for client-side API calls.

---

## Verifying the Installation

After the development servers have started successfully:

- Open `http://localhost:3000`
- Navigate to the Dashboard Overview
- Confirm that the Agent reports a healthy status
- Verify that both MCP servers appear in the MCP Registry page
- Open the Tool Catalog and confirm tools have been discovered
- Open the Chat Console and submit a prompt requiring tool usage
- Check the Audit Logs to verify that execution events are being recorded

If all of the above work successfully, the platform has been configured correctly.
